Since I come to Canada I looked for a way to transfer my pension plan from origin country. Canada's RRSP is more flexible than a pension plan in my origin country.

An RRSP is a retirement saving account for employees and the self-employed. The pre-tax money tat placed into an RRSP and grows tax-free until withdrawal. When the money withdrawal they taxed at the marginal rate.

There is a lot of discussions online regarding RRSP is suitable for your financial situation or you should use different saving accounts like TFSA or Unregistered, however, this is not for this article.

**RRSPs have three main advantages.**
- the contributions to RRSP are from pre-tax money and will be deducted from the income.
- the grows of RRSP investment is tax-free.
- the grows of RRSP investment on the bigger amount than in after-tax money investment accounts.

**RRSPs disadvantages**
- the taxes are paid when the money withdrawal at the marginal rate include the gain (comparing to an unregistered account the taxes on the gain is just half of the marginal rate)

There are a number of RRSP types, however, for this transfer, you should use **Individual RRSP**

In addition to RRSP type, you should choose a type of investment for your RRSP account before you start to transfer the money. There several types of investment permitted in RRSP.
- Mutual funds
- Exchange-traded funds
- Equities
- Bonds
- Savings accounts
- Mortgage loans
- Income trusts
- Guaranteed investment certificates
- Foreign currency
- Labor-sponsored funds

The description of all the types is a topic for another article, I will skip it here.
I use Mutual funds (Indexes) for my RRSP.

The RRSP contribution limit for 2019 is 18% of the earned income as was reported on the previous year tax return, up to a maximum of $26,500. If you contribute more than $2,000 you will be hit with penalties. You have to pay a tax of 1% per month on excess contributions.

***Tip:** The pension transfer is not affected by the contribution limit and will not take the available contribution room.*

**Pre-requirements for the pension transfer:**
- Your country of origin should have tax treaty with Canada. For example for Israel it is explained in ARTICLE 17
Pensions and Annuities of [Canadaâ€“Israel Tax Convention Act, 2016](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-6.42/FullText.html)
- The pension transfer should happen in one tax year. You should withdraw the pension money from origin country and deposit to RRSP in the same tax year or not after 60 days of the tax year-end.
- The foreign pension should be contributed before you become a resident of Canada for tax purposes.
- You should have enough federal payable taxes to get the origin country taxes back. For example, you should pay in origin country $10K taxes when you withdraw your pension, so you have to have federal payable taxes in Canada more or equal to $10K. CRA does not return money that you did not pay to CRA.
- You should fill tax return in origin country for the year when you withdraw the pension.
- You have to have available amount money to cover the origin's country taxes. When you deposit the pension money to RRSP you should add the amount of taxes that you paid to origin country.
- You should be less than 71 years old in the year when you transfer the pension.

***Tip:** In case you don't have enough federal payable taxes, consider to split the transfer to several years.*

**After all the preparations we are ready for the actions.**
- Withdraw the pension in origin country and pay the taxes.
- Transfer the pension money to Canada. You can transfer to any your account in Canada. A checking account also suitable for the transfer. Note the exchange rate that used for the exchange the origin country to Canadian dollars. You will use this exchange rate to convert all the amounts to Canadian dollars.

***Tip:** You can use the actual exchange rate when you did the exchange or the average rate for this year.*
- Deposit the pension money to RRSP account together with the additional amount that equals to taxes that you paid in origin country. So in the end, you should have on the RRSP account exact same amount that you had on origin's country pension account.
- Fill the tax return in the origin country.
- Translate the tax return to English by a certified translator.

**Fill Canadian taxes**

I did not try the following steps as I used accountant service to fill my Canadian taxes.
- Include the whole pension amount include foreign taxes that you deposited to your RRSP as income for the year. Line 115 of Federal Tax return form - Other pensions and superannuation.
- Deduct the RRSP amount from income: line 208 - RRSP deduction. And on line 11, Schedule 7, mark that the RRSP is a transfer. This will say that the RRSP amount should not affect your contribution limits.
- Receiving Foreign Tax Credit.

The foreign tax return form is not required when you fill the Canadian tax return. The CRA will contact you on summer with a request for supporting documents for this transfer this is when you send the form to CRA.
