<h5>Mortgage</h5>
<p>
    The mortgage interest calculated by comparing two amortization schedules, with the amount as a lump payment and
    without. In addition, every month the inflation rate is reduced from the difference of the interest payments and
    added the initial amount.
</p>
<p>
    Monthly Difference = Interest Payment - Interest Payment with Lump Payment - Inflation + Amount
</p>
<h5>RRSP</h5>
<p>
    The RRSP investment amount is different from other account types as when you select reinvest the Tax Return, the Tax
    Return based on Marginal Tax Rate is added to the amount. The Gain is reduced by the retirement
    (horizon) effective tax rate.
</p>
<h5>Non Registered</h5>
<p>
    The gain is reduced by a half of the retirement (horizon) marginal tax rate.
